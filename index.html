        <h3>who is this?</h3>

<p>We are a network of technologists seeking to advance the e-learning industry by doing our own research &amp; development. Often, content and tools firms are too small or too strategically focused to explore and evaluate new techniques and technologies. As a result, the learning industry tends to lag behind the state of the art. Our hope is to serve that need through free and open source initiatives. The aim is a bias toward unique benefits and simplicity so our work is valuable to our colleagues, both technical and nontechnical.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/treefarm" class="user-mention">@treefarm</a> is a group of folks with a love for learning, technology, and clean design who believe the open exchange of ideas is one of the best ways to quickly make great leaps forward. Although there are a few big exceptions, for the most part e-learning vendors cannot afford to expose themselves to the financial risks inherent to R&amp;D. For that reason, our strategy is to forge ahead as a community and mitigate that risk by making light work through large-scale collaboration.</p>

<h3>what do you do?</h3>

<p>The plan for <a href="https://github.com/treefarm" class="user-mention">@treefarm</a> is to explore a wide variety of technical topics relevant to learning and collaboration, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plugin-free peer-to-peer data exchange for real time collaborative applications</li>
<li>Plugin-free video/audio recording and streaming</li>
<li>Real-time collaborative development</li>
<li>Unique applications for the <a href="https://github.com/adlnet" class="user-mention">@adlnet</a> <a href="https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec">xAPI</a>
</li>
<li>Methods for achieving uniquely authentic mobile learning experiences</li>
</ul><h3>how can I help?</h3>

<p>I'm glad you asked! This is a humble grassroots initiative being fueled by deep passion for sustainable change for the better in an e-learning industry that can sometimes be a bit staid. Anyone of like mind regardless of background is welcome to contribute whether it be in the form of ideas, research, engineering, documentation, or what have you.</p>

<p>We'd especially welcome help from folks with the following background:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Graphic Designer</strong> this could be a great opportunity to build a portfolio of unique works</li>
<li>
<strong>Community Manager</strong> anyone with a talent for social promotion looking for an outlet</li>
<li>
<strong>Engineer</strong> all skill levels welcome, but we are building a core team of experienced technical generalists</li>
</ul><p>Contact <a href="https://github.com/treefarm" class="user-mention">@treefarm</a> to let us know what you'd like to do!</p>

<h3>where is all of this going to happen?</h3>

<p>We'll share all of our code via github, probably use google groups as a discussion space (ideas?), and inform the community via google+, facebook, and twitter.</p>
