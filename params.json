{"name":"treefarm","tagline":"learning technologies collaborative","body":"### who is this?\r\nWe are a network of technologists seeking to advance the e-learning industry by doing our own research & development. Often, content and tools firms are too small or too strategically focused to explore and evaluate new techniques and technologies. As a result, the learning industry tends to lag behind the state of the art. Our hope is to serve that need through free and open source initiatives. The aim is a bias toward unique benefits and simplicity so our work is valuable to our colleagues, both technical and nontechnical.\r\n\r\n@treefarm is a group of folks with a love for learning, technology, and clean design who believe the open exchange of ideas is one of the best ways to quickly make great leaps forward. Although there are a few big exceptions, for the most part e-learning vendors cannot afford to expose themselves to the financial risks inherent to R&D. For that reason, our strategy is to forge ahead as a community and mitigate that risk by making light work through large-scale collaboration.\r\n\r\n### what do you do?\r\nThe plan for @treefarm is to explore a wide variety of technical topics relevant to learning and collaboration, such as:\r\n* Plugin-free peer-to-peer data exchange for real time collaborative applications\r\n* Plugin-free video/audio recording and streaming\r\n* Real-time collaborative development\r\n* Unique applications for the @adlnet [xAPI](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec)\r\n* Methods for achieving uniquely authentic mobile learning experiences\r\n\r\n### how can I help?\r\nI'm glad you asked! This is a humble grassroots initiative being fueled by deep passion for sustainable change for the better in an e-learning industry that can sometimes be a bit staid. Anyone of like mind regardless of background is welcome to contribute whether it be in the form of ideas, research, engineering, documentation, or what have you.\r\n\r\nWe'd especially welcome help from folks with the following background:\r\n* **Graphic Designer** this could be a great opportunity to build a portfolio of unique works\r\n* **Community Manager** anyone with a talent for social promotion looking for an outlet\r\n* **Engineer** all skill levels welcome, but we are building a core team of experienced technical generalists\r\n\r\nContact @treefarm to let us know what you'd like to do!\r\n\r\n### where is all of this going to happen?\r\nWe'll share all of our code via github, probably use google groups as a discussion space (ideas?), and inform the community via google+, facebook, and twitter.","google":"UA-40436394-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
