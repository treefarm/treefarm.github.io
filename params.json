{"name":"treefarm","tagline":"learning technologies collaborative","body":"We are a network of learning technologies professionals seeking to advance the industry by doing our own R&D. Often, e-learning firms are too small or too focused to explore and evaluate new techniques and technologies. As a result, the learning industry tends to lag behind. Our hope is to serve that need through free and open source initiatives. We aim to maximize benefit and simplicity so our work is valuable to our colleagues, both technical and nontechnical.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
